Develop an MLP application system that can deal with .cal data set.

<ul>

 <li>Analyze the data structure requirements of an MLP to design a class for the MLP neural network system with the following capabilities:

  <ul>

   <li>can read in a .cal data set file.</li>

   <li>can configure an NN based on userâ€™s specification of hidden neurons and the read-in data set.</li>

   <li>can normalize values of each data field of the training and testing data sets.</li>

   <li>can randomly shuffle the data instances in the data sets to generate different sets of training data and testing data.</li>

   <li>can perform an epoch of data training and report the root mean square of the error.</li>

   <li>can test the trained NN using the testing data and report the correctness based on the classification confusing table.</li>

   <li>can perform a simple forward computation using raw input vector (normalized by your code) and return raw output vector (converting back).</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Add graphics display for user to visualize the structure of the NN and the process of training.</li>

 <li>Prepare a folder named as &lt;your ID&gt;&lt;your name&gt;Ass12 to put your source code in it. Compress it as an rar file; submit the rar file to course web site.</li>

</ul>
